			<hr>
			<div id="read-more-text" class="text font--wht center read-more-text-class">
				<p class="blue">
					Our story begins with 2 North County kids who probably crossed paths more than once until they finally found each other by way of a friend and a cousin who were themselves, married.
				</p>
				<p class="blue">
					On a Monday afternoon the week before Memorial Day, 2014, Scott drove over to the house of his good friend, former roommate, and future groomsman, Tim Blattel, so they could practice their washer tosses ahead of the big annual Memorial Day washer tournament that they would be competing in. They had actually made it pretty far in the previous competition after years of steady improvement. While practicing this day, it was wildly apparent that this year’s showing would actually be quite poor, as neither of them could hit the broad side of a barn. But during the session, Tim’s wife Maggie came outside to see how it was going. Scott thought nothing of the interaction, but the next week he received a text from Tim… or rather from Maggie using Tim’s phone. She said that it was great catching up the other day, and she wondered if Scott would have any interest in going on a blind date with her cousin, Tree. Scott had never really done anything like that before, and in years past likely would have said no. But after some deliberation, he decided to take the plunge. At the time, he thought the main reason was because some recent life changes had him feeling more confident than he had been previously in his life, and he thought if ever there was a time to try something like this, it was then. As it came to pass, however, one has to wonder whether there were other forces at work.
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					The date was set for a Monday, June 9th to be exact, and Scott’s 29th birthday, to be exactly exact. He didn’t share that particular bit of info, though- why draw all the attention to himself? It was actually a blind double date, with Maggie and Tim attending to help reduce some of the pressure (very appreciated, by the way). It took place at Llewelyn’s Pub on Main Street St Charles, a good halfway point between North County where Tree still resided, and O’Fallon Missouri where Scott had migrated to after college. The dinner went well, nothing to write home about, actually, in the eyes of either person. Tim and Maggie then said they had to “hurry home” to check on their daughter, leaving Tree and Scott to head to the restaurant’s bar to have an after-dinner drink and continue the date. One drink turned into two, and likely would have been three if both parties weren’t driving themselves home. See Moms, we listened! Topics ranged from the finer points of Star Wars to a sharing of each other’s favorite Christmas traditions, and finished with Scott trying to do the gentlemanly thing of walking Tree to her car with his umbrella that he had brought knowing it was going to rain that evening. Unfortunately, he did a really crummy job and she actually didn’t stay particularly dry (please see the previous paragraph about Scott’s inexperience in this field). But lucky for him, he had made as much of an impression on her as she did on him, and they agreed that a second date was warranted.
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					That second date was at Cannoli’s Italian restaurant on Lindbergh, right near Tree’s neck of the woods. Scott used to go there as a kid with his family, so he thought this would lend some welcome familiarity to a date with just the two of them. He came to find out that Tree actually used to go there as a kid with her family also. That was the beginning of what proved to be a very common theme as Tree and Scott got to know each other – a continuing series of shared experiences and coincidences that after like the 6th or 7th one started to seem like maybe they weren’t actually coincidences at all. Cannoli’s was followed by frozen custard at Fritz’s. Well, the custard part lasted about 15 minutes, but the conversation lasted about 3 or 4 hours as near as either can remember. “My grandparents used to attend St. Jerome’s parish.” “So did my family, I was actually baptized there!” “I used to work at the Steak n’ Shake at McDonnell Blvd and 270.” “Oh my god, I used to go there all the time in high school, you probably cooked my food!” And on and on it went, each date serving as more and more evidence that there was something special beginning to happen.
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					Before long, they were officially boyfriend and girlfriend and knocking out all the major milestones. The first time they said “I Love You” at Scott’s friend’s wedding (he requested the song “Faithfully” by Journey, she responded as all guys expect, “Thank God you finally said it, I’ve almost slipped and said it first so many times!”). Their first Thanksgiving, their first Christmas. Their first Valentine’s Day, which was an awesome Journey cover band playing at Powell Symphony Hall (because Tree is really big about doing things “On Theme”). In March came the big decision to move in together. Before they knew it, June 9th had come around again and the first anniversary was celebrated back at the St. Charles Riverfront. As an aside, it had been previously decided that Scott’s birthday would temporarily move to June 8th to accommodate the other festivities. Finally, at the Larkin Thanksgiving of 2015, Scott came to a realization. While telling the family why he was thankful for Maggie, for introducing him to his beloved Tree (a very necessary do-over from the previous Thanksgiving as some of you know), Scott had the epiphany that all evidence had heretofore been pointing him to. He loved Tree more than anything in this world, and he knew that it was finally time. It was time to propose.
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					The question was how, but it really wasn’t much of a question. As mentioned previously, both of them love Christmas; Tree perhaps a bit more. No, not perhaps, it’s like a lot more. Like kind of an unhealthy amount more. Regardless, Scott knew there was only one course of action. A Christmas morning proposal. He actually decided on a Christmas morning scavenger hunt that would end with the proposal under the Christmas Tree. A lot of planning and deception were required. He “had to stay late at work” that one Saturday afternoon so he could actually go buy the ring with the help of co-conspirator and co-Maid of Honor Marcia Siemer. He took a random Tuesday off work to take their dog (well child, basically) Penny to her vet, Doctor Rich (Scott’s Dad). It went unsaid that stops were also made to purchase items for the scavenger hunt. When Tree left the house another Saturday to help her sister and other co-Maid of Honor Sammi move, Scott hustled his way over to future Mother-in-Law Beverly’s house to ask her permission to marry Tree. The day after, Scott was somewhat suspiciously late getting back from the Rams game– he had to ask Tree’s Dad Tim for his permission– but boy that game traffic was horrible, wasn’t it? Special props to Tree’s parents and ESPECIALLY Marcia and Sammi for keeping the secret for so many weeks. As you might imagine, it was not particularly easy!
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					Finally Christmas Eve arrived. The night before the biggest moment of Scott’s life. No one else at Bev’s annual get-together, besides those mentioned above, knew what was to happen the next morning. Even Tim and Maggie were only told as they were packing up their car outside to leave, because if Scott didn’t tell someone he was going to have a coronary. The deception was almost complete. And it was very much working, too. Tree actually had been pondering whether Scott might be getting ready to propose. But when they got in their car to head home from Bev’s house with no knee being bent, she decided nothing was imminent. I mean, if he didn’t do it in front of the family at Christmas Eve, surely he wasn’t going to do it, right? Muah ha ha ha!!
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					The final step was setting up the scavenger hunt. Scott had done several dry runs and gotten all the props together in his desk drawer outside of the bedroom, so that he could get to work while Tree lay in bed falling asleep. The real thing took much longer than the dry runs and Scott thought for sure he would be found out.  Luckily for him, but not for Tree, she was actually fighting off an oncoming cold and she was OUT, not at all noticing Scott’s suspicious absence.
				</p>
				<p class="odd-font">
					AND THE REST IS HISTORY… I of course woke up before the crack of dawn for Christmas and we finished opening presents, only to be led on the MOST THOUGHTFUL scavenger hunt this world has ever seen (seriously, it was the kind of thing that only happens in the best of rom coms). Still knowing Scott’s odd sense of humor, I just tried to keep my calm reminding myself I could be on a hunt for anything so don’t get my hopes up. As I worked through the clues, reading letters leading to the next, each more funny and touching than the last, it ended in front our Christmas Tree where he was waiting on one knee, ring in hand, and so of course I said the first thing (and only thing) that came to mind “Thank God you finally asked, of course!” (or some variation, he swears it was hard to decipher through me crying). And so we end up here on this site to share information with our family and friends. Thank you for taking the time to get to know a little more about us.  We cannot wait for the big day to celebrate with all of our family and friends as we begin the rest of our lives together (I’m definitely getting the better end of the deal). We will see you all on the dance floor March 18, 2017!!!!
